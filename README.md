## Deep Dive Insights
Sales Trends:

•	Across all years, there is a strong seasonal peaks in Q4 especially November & December consistently showing an increase in sales, after a drop in sales from October, this is possibly attributed to the holiday shopping seasonality (Black Friday and year-end promotions).


•	2020 experienced the highest growth in every month for all major KPI's such as total sales, order count, and AOV, particularly from April through September, likely influenced by pandemic-driven e-commerce surges. Notably, April, May, June, and August 2020 all had over 200% YoY sales growth, suggesting a strong mid-year acceleration.

•	2022 shows significant declines in all KPIs, especially in Q4 with October, November and December showing YoY total sales dropping >70%, indicating either market saturation, economic slowdown, or reduced promotional effectiveness.

## Product Performance
•	The 27 inch 4K Gaming Monitor, Apple Airpods Headphones, and MacBook Air Laptop (22.39%) together account for >84% of total revenue, highlighting their critical importance in the product portfolio.

•	Bose SoundSport Headphones have significantly underperformed—generating less than 1% of total revenue despite an AOV of $35 cheaper than Apple AirPods. This suggests that lower price alone hasn’t translated into higher demand.

•	Apple Iphone is surprisingly underperforming while its other 2 products have been wildly successful. This could possibly be due to consumer preference for smartphone selection or higher competition and pricing in the smartphone market.

•	All top 4 products saw a sharp spike in 2020 YoY growth, with MacBook Air Laptop showing the strongest jump at 384% followed by ThinkPad Laptop at 222% likely driven by remote work and e-learning needs during the pandemic. However, in 2021 both products had the steepest declines  with ThinkPad Laptop dropping -20% in YoY growth and MacBook Air(-35%) indicating possible market saturation or reduced demand.

## Recommendations
Product Outreach: 

• Diversify the product mix. Over 85% of total revenue is concentrated in just three products: the 27" Gaming Monitor, MacBook Air, and Apple AirPods. This limits growth potential. Consider expanding more products similar to these to expand growth.

• Discontinue or reposition low-performing products such as Bose SoundSport Headphones which contributed only 0.01% of total sales over 4 years. Bundle this product with compatible devices or offer clearance pricing to reduce excess inventory.

Global Impact:

•	Focus resources on high-revenue markets. North America and EMEA generated >75% of dominant sales share. Continue investing in these regions while exploring growth opportunities in LATAM and APAC through localized campaigns and pricing adjustments.

•	Maximize potential in high-AOV countries  like Australia ($392 AOV), Denmark ($353), and Israel ($302) present opportunities for premium product upsells or bundles due to their demonstrated willingness to spend more per transaction

Loyalty Program Performance:

• Continue investing in the loyalty program, as members outperformed non-members in 2021 and 2022 across key KPIs such as higher total orders, greater sales, and stronger average order value(AOV).

•Focus marketing on Direct Marketing Channel which had the highest signup rate (40%) and a total of 23.5K loyalty member signups and Email Marketing Channel which generated 59% signup rate with 8K signups

Refund monitoring:

•Investigate recurring issues with MacBook Air Laptops and Apple AirPods Headphones by reviewing customer feedback, and return reasons to identify root causes and implement product or service improvement.

•Optimize the post-purchase service experience and improve product durability to sustain low refunds. With zero refunds reported in 2022, maintaining this standard should be a continued priority.
