## Company Performance Overview :
Electronics R US , a digital electronics retailer launched in 2019, has rapidly grown its footprint across international markets. With a focus on online and mobile channels, the company has seen strong performance from key product lines, particularly those from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad. This analysis was to support cross-functional teams—including sales, marketing, and finance and provide meaningful insights. The objective was to provide a clear view of company performance, helping each team refine their workflows and strengthen the customer experience across global markets.

## Key Stakeholder Questions: 
•	What were the monthly and yearly number of sales throughout 2019 and 2022? What about AOV and total sales in dollars? How did this differ by product and geography?

•	Which months and products performed the best / worst? Is there seasonality?

•	Should we keep using the loyalty program?

•	What was the monthly number of sales and yearly AOV for people in the loyalty program vs. those not in the loyalty program?

•	Has there been any new customer growth for loyalty members?

•	What are the refund rates for different products?

•	How does it compare between loyal and non-loyal customers?

•	How are the sales across regions? 

•	Are the regions with the highest spike the same regions responsible for the highest sales dollars?

## Executive Summary

•	From 2019 to 2022 the average yearly sales revenue was $7M, the average total orders per year was 27K and the average AOV was $260.06. 2020 was the strongest for revenue with +$10M in sales and average order value being $300.16. 2021 had the highest order count at 35,858.

•	The loyalty Program should be kept as it has shown promise in AOV increase since 2019 for loyalty members, and has been bringing in new distinct members in the last two years for 2021 and 2022. Additionally, loyalty members have brought in $1M more in revenue for the past 2 years compared to non-loyalty members.

## Deep Dive Insights
Sales Trends:

•	Across all years, there is a strong seasonal peaks in Q4 especially November & December consistently showing an increase in sales, after a drop in sales from October, this is possibly attributed to the holiday shopping seasonality (Black Friday and year-end promotions).


•	2020 experienced the highest growth in total sales, order count, and AOV, particularly in April through September, likely influenced by pandemic-driven e-commerce surges. Notably, April, May, June, and August 2020 all had over 200% YoY sales growth, suggesting a strong mid-year acceleration.

•	2022 shows significant declines in all KPIs, especially from May onward, with October and November showing YoY total sales drops of over -71%, indicating either market saturation, economic slowdown, or reduced promotional effectiveness.

## Product Performance
-- Top Products by Contribution to Total Sales:
•	The 27 inch 4K Gaming Monitor leads all product categories, contributing 35.04% of total sales, followed by Apple Airpods Headphones (27.53%) and MacBook Air Laptop (22.39%).
•	These three products together account for >84% of total revenue, highlighting their critical importance in the product portfolio.
--Worst Products by Contribution to Total Sales:
•	Bose SoundSport Headphones have significantly underperformed—generating less than 1% of total revenue despite an AOV of $35 cheaper than Apple AirPods. This suggests that lower price alone hasn’t translated into higher demand.
•	Apple Iphone is surprisingly underperforming while its other 2 products have been wildly successful. This could possibly due to consumer preference for smartphone selection or higher competition and pricing in the smartphone market.
--Explosive Growth in 2020, Followed by Declines:
•	All top 4 products saw a sharp spike in 2020 YoY growth, with MacBook Air Laptop showing the strongest jump at 384%, likely driven by remote work and e-learning needs during the pandemic. However, by 2022, all four top products experienced negative growth rates, with ThinkPad Laptop and MacBook Air showing the steepest declines, indicating possible market saturation or reduced demand.
