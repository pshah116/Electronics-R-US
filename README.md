## Company Performance Overview :
Electronics R US , a digital electronics retailer launched in 2019, has rapidly grown its footprint across international markets. With a focus on online and mobile channels, the company has seen strong performance from key product lines, particularly those from Apple, Samsung, and ThinkPad.

•	Should we keep using the loyalty program?

•	What was the monthly number of sales and yearly AOV for people in the loyalty program vs. those not in the loyalty program?

•	Has there been any new customer growth for loyalty members?

•	What are the refund rates for different products?

•	How does it compare between loyal and non-loyal customers?

•	How are the sales across regions?
